# AS3 Utils

AS3 Utils package for Sublime Text 2 that enhances the default AS3 package. Still in beta, but everything works so far. I use this every day. I'm waiting to add more features before adding it to the package list of Package Control.

## Imports completions for all Adobe's classes
- You can write the name of the class (eg: Sprite) or the name of the folder (eg: events) and you will get a list of possible matches. Obviously this only works in the imports section inside package but outside class.

## Methods completions for all Adobe's methods
  - Write any method name and you will get a list of matches. As there are many duplicated results from different classes I've put the name of the class in the autocomplete list. For example "addChild" will throw differetn results, most likely you will want to use the one from "DisplayObjectContainer".
  - So far only required parameters are included in the snippets, optional parameters are ignored.
  - There are still some conflicts with compeltions from the current file... I got around this by installing the (very useful) All Autocomplete package available through Package Control.

## Properties and Constants completions for all Adobe's classes
- Completions for things such as numChildren, length, etc.
- Completions for things such as events, math constants, textfield autosize, stage qality, etc. The trigger is the constant eg: MOUSE_DOWN will return MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN

## Some useful snippets
  - <b>Class snippet</b> (trigger: class). It will create the default class structure, and use the name of the file for the class name and the constructor. For example MyClass.as will return MyClass. First save your file and then use the snippet.
  - <b>Function snippet</b> (trigger: function). The access control keywords are "dynamic". The whole list will appear (public/private/protected/internal), but if you type "pub" "public" will get written, "pri" will write "private", etc. Then press tab again to go to the next tab cursor in the snippet.
  - <b>For each</b> snippet (trigger: for each)
  - <b>For in</b> snippet (trigger: for in)
  - <b>Var snippet</b> (trigger: var). The access control keywords are "dynamic", just like the function snippet.
  - <b>Constant snippet</b> (trigger: const). Works exactly as the Var snippet.
  - <b>Comment block snippet</b> (trigger: block). It will create a nice comment block for visually organizing parts of your code.
  - <b>Trace snippet</b> (trigger: trace)
  - <b>setTimeout snippet</b> (trigger: setTimeout)
